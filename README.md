# Project-Proposal

Our Project is E-Voting with ethereum Blockchain, in start we will create interface of the e-voting system using React,html and css and later we will write smart contracts for this using solidity.

We will achieve this with blockchain because it is more secure due to its hash values and keys. Data will be stored forever so no loss of data is possible, and this system canâ€™t be hacked because blockchain is a decentralized database.

## Why Blockchain?
Blockchain is a decentralized data that means data is available to everyone who is using ethereum so it can't be hacked.

Blockchain consist of blocks and for each block there is a nonce value and a hash value, for every block the hash value is different from others block and all hashes are connected to one another in a chain

So if somone try to manipulate the data and try to change that hash value then the chain of that hash values will break.

Hash value is a 64 hex character long alpha numeric key.
